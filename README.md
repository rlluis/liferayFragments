Up to now this collection only includes one and only fragment: a news ticker that will show a scrolling electronic display of a Collecion defined in Liferay.

 - Define the background color of the left part
 - Define the Text Color of the right part (the headlines from the Collection)

To create something like this (just the Announcements bar below the Advices' label):
